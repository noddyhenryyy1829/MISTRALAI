Your job is to extract the following fields from the customer's email. These values may appear in various formats, such as uppercase, abbreviations, or colon/dash-separated text.

Extract the following (if available):

1. Account Number — may appear as:
   - "Account No", "A/c No", "AC NO", etc.

2. User ID — may appear as:
   - "User ID", "Userid", "Login ID", etc.

3. Mobile Number — may appear as:

   - Can include country code or symbols

4. Email Address — may appear as:
   - "Email", "Email ID", "Mail ID", etc.
   - Sometimes repeated in brackets like [xyz@example.com]

Return your output strictly in this JSON format:

{{
  "account_number": "...",
  "user_id": "...",
  "mobile_number": "...",
  "email": "..."
}}

If a field is not present, return it as an empty string "".

Extract the following entities from the given email. Normalize all field names and formats in the output. If any field is not present, return its value as null. Output should be valid JSON with these exact keys:

- "AC/No 1"
- "AC/No 2"
- "Name"
- "Mobile Number"
- "Email ID"
- "User ID"
- "Corporate ID"

Guidelines:
- For account numbers, accept formats like "A/c No", "Account Number", "AC NO", etc., but output must always use "AC/No" as key.
- For email, handle variations like "EMAIL", "E-mail", "EMAIL ID", etc., but always use "Email ID" in output.
- For mobile number, accept 10-digit values with/without symbols (e.g., dashes or country codes).
- For name, look for labels like "AC NAME", "Account Holder", or "Mr./Ms." but use "Name" in output.
- For user ID or corporate ID, standardize to keys "User ID" and "Corporate ID" regardless of input variation.

Only return the JSON object. Do not include any explanations or copied labels.

but the prediction were bad so what should i do with

so bsially we receive mails on our portal so we need to classify them into categories like 
internet banking > request > unlock 
mobile banking > transaction > money debited adn so one we have 200 such categories as of now so we want whatever the new mail will come the moidel should lassify them
into one of the following 200 categoires so which would be the best option ?
